        <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
        <p>
            Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of 
            the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in 
            Japan for the Game Boy,and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their 
                          developers.

            <div class="flex-item head first">Water</div>
            <div class="flex-item ">
                Water is one of the three basic  elemental types 
                along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three 
                starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type 
                concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon,
                 which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                    Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which 
                    constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type 
                    concept easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so 
                    choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

                    statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.

                <p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting
                     out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves.
                      A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

        <h2>Q and A</h2>
        <h4>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h4>
        <div class="ques">
            <ol type="1">
                <li><h4>1. What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for 
                    every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger 
                    evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a 
                    question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>  
                    <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>2. What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</h4></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up
                     with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented 
                     with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
                  <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>   
                </ul>
