        <h2>What are Pocket Monsters?</h2>
        <p>
            Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of 
            the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in 
            Japan for the Game Boy,and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their 
                          developers.

                Water is one of the three basic  elemental types 
                along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three 
                starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type 
                concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon,
                 which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                    choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

        <h4>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h4>
        <div class="ques">
            <ol type="none">
                <li><h4>1. What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</h4></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for 
                    every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger 
                    evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a 
                    question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>  
                    <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
                </ul>
                <li><h4>2. What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</h4></li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up
                     with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented 
                     with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
                  <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

                Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in brief, 
                things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.

                  The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
                  created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
                  Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
                  after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
                  Green version was not released outside Japan

          2000 and European release date of April 2001. Like the previous
